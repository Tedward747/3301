If you aren't sure what this is for, it probably isn't very useful to you.

Collection of tools and such I've come up with to help along the way.

## [Convert To Runes](Convert%20To%20Runes)

Script to clean up text (i.e. remove anything not A-Z, (space) or \n), remove any words containing Q if option is specified, and convert result to runes.

## [Letter Frequency](Letter%20Frequency)

Script to take in word document and analyse letter frequency.  Works on both English and runes.
